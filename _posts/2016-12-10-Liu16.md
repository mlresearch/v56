title: Transferring Knowledge from Text to Predict Disease Onset
abstract: In many domains such as medicine, training data is in short supply. In such
  cases, external knowledge is often helpful in building predictive models. We propose
  a novel method to incorporate publicly available domain expertise to build accurate
  models. Specifically, we use word2vec models trained on a domain-specific corpus
  to estimate the relevance of each feature’s text description to the prediction problem.
  We use these relevance estimates to rescale the features, causing more important
  features to experience weaker regularization. We apply our method to predict the
  onset of five chronic diseases in the next five years in two genders and two age
  groups. Our rescaling approach improves the accuracy of the model, particularly
  when there are few positive examples. Furthermore, our method selects 60% fewer
  features, easing interpretation by physicians. Our method is applicable to other
  domains where feature and outcome descriptions are available.
