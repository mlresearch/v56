title: Multi-task Prediction of Disease Onsets from Longitudinal Laboratory Tests
abstract: Disparate areas of machine learning have benefited from models that can
  take raw data with little preprocessing as input and learn rich representations
  of that raw data in order to perform well on a given prediction task. We evaluate
  this approach in healthcare by using longitudinal measurements of lab tests, one
  of the more raw signals of a patient’s health state widely available in clinical
  data, to predict disease onsets. In particular, we train a Long Short-Term Memory
  (LSTM) recurrent neural network and two novel convolutional neural networks for
  multi-task prediction of disease onset for 133 conditions based on 18 common lab
  tests measured over time in a cohort of 298K patients derived from 8 years of administrative
  claims data. We compare the neural networks to a logistic regression with several
  hand-engineered, clinically relevant features. We find that the representation-based
  learning approaches significantly outperform this baseline. We believe that our
  work suggests a new avenue for patient risk stratification based solely on lab results.
